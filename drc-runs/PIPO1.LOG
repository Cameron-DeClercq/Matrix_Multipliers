INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /opt/cadence/gpdk045/gpdk045_v_6_0/gpdk045/gpdk045.layermap
INFO (XSTRM-280): The output file will be a compressed file because the file name has extension .gz
INFO (XSTRM-162): You have not used the viaMap option. If the OpenAccess design has native oaVia instances, use the -viaMap option for preserving oaVia instances in a Stream Out - Stream In round trip. Using the -viaMap option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.  For details on the viaMap option, refer to the "Design Data Translator's Reference" guide for XStream.
