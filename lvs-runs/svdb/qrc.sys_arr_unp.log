WARNING (EXTQRCXOPT-381) : The output_db -hierarchy_delimiter option value cannot be an empty string.
It is now set to be the same as that of the input_db -hierarchy_delimiter
option. If input_db -hierarchy_delimiter is not set, then output_db
-hierarchy_delimiter is set to the default value ("/" character).
